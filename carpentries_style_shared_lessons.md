# Carpentries style materials

Here are a collection of Carpentries style lessons. These are not part of the official carpentries curriculum, but are a good source of inspiration whenever you need them. Would be awesome if you could add examples! please contact [me](https://twitter.com/orchid00). 

If you want your lessons to be part of the currilumn you can propose them to [The Carpentries Incubator](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/proposals): The Incubator will serve as a single point of entry for lessons or ideas at any stage in the development process.

## R

- Git using Rstudio used to be https://stijnvanhoey.github.io/git-Rstudio-course/ and now moved to The Carpentries Incubator! [https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/git-Rstudio-course/](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/git-Rstudio-course/) This is a short lesson to teach git from RStudio using The Carpentries style version 9.5.0. developed by Stjin van Hoey, you can contact me @orchid00 if you have questions or @stijnvanhoey on github and @SVanHoey on twitter.
- https://tibhannover.github.io/FAIR-R/ -- Fork of r-novice-inflammation that focusses on function docu, packaging & testing. 
Was used in https://tibhannover.github.io/2018-07-09-FAIR-Data-and-Software/
- https://uomresearchit.github.io/r-tidyverse-intro/ --a condensed version of the Software Carpentry intro to R lesson, 
with tidyverse and a bit of modeling thrown in.
- Quantitative Trait Mapping https://smcclatchy.github.io/mapping/ This lesson introduces genetic mapping using qtl2, a R package for analyzing quantitative phenotypes and genetic data from complex crosses like the Diversity Outbred (DO).

- Vim and advanced bash https://afdataschool.github.io/vim-bash/ 

## Git - Version Control

- Customised from git - https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/git-novice-custom/ - Teaches branches and pull requests
- CodeRefinery git intro https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/ - Guacamole example
- Collaborative distributed version control https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/ - Working with remotes, pull requests, and code review
- Git branch design https://coderefinery.github.io/git-branch-design/ - Rebase vs. merge, avoiding conflicts, branching models
- Git - Github - Rstudio https://inbo.github.io/git-course/
- Steve Bond (Biologyguy)'s Git and Github with examples that make more sense IRL: https://biologyguy.github.io/git-novice/
Two hour edition targeted at IT pros based on this version: https://dlstrong.github.io/git-novice/. I teach 
this as a full day lesson, and use a cut-down version for SWC workshops: http://gcapes.github.io/git-course. Writing a paper 
as the narrative, covers branches, revert, reset, rebase, remotes, PRs.
- Modified version of git-novice that uses Git Desktop and uses editing a carpentry data file as example: 
https://caltechlibrary.github.io/git-desktop/
- SWC https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/git-novice-custom/ - Teaches branches and pull requests
- Git beyond the basics https://m4rkd.github.io/git-beyond-the-basics/
- Introduction to Git and GitHub https://elizabeth-dupre.com/git-course/ (forked from gcapes/git-course) by [@emdupre](https://github.com/emdupre)
- Git Intro [https://csiro-data-school.github.io/git-intro](https://csiro-data-school.github.io/git-intro){target="_blank"} by CSIRO data school
